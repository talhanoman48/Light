# Light: An Educational Chatbot for Computer Science Students
Light is a chatbot that aims to help computer science students in need of assistance with their coursework, assignments, or projects. Light can answer questions related to various topics in computer science, such as data structures, algorithms, programming languages, databases, etc.

## Features
Light uses a CNN-based architecture to classify user intent and respond to the queries. The architecture is defined in the *main.py* file.
Light is trained on a large dataset of computer science questions and answers collected from various sources, such as Stack Overflow, Quora, Reddit, etc.
Light can handle multiple types of questions, such as factual, conceptual, procedural, or opinion-based.
Light can also evaluate and critique the studentsâ€™ code snippets and provide constructive feedback and best practices.
